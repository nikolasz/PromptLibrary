Rationale
The project is designed to create a GitHub project for a prompt library that can be used to interact with GPT-4. The project contains prompts, scripts, tests, and docs for the prompt library. The project aims to achieve the following goals:

To provide a collection of prompts that can instruct AI models to perform various tasks, such as translation, text generation, summarization, etc.
To provide a way to generate new prompts from existing ones by modifying or combining them
To provide a way to send prompts to the OpenAI API and retrieve responses
To provide a way to organize and manage the prompts in the library
To provide a way to test the functionality and the quality of the scripts and the prompts
To provide a way to document the project and its usage
The project is designed using Python as the main programming language, as it is widely used for AI-related projects and has many libraries and modules that can facilitate the development. The project is also designed to be compatible with the OpenAI API, which is the interface for accessing GPT-4 and other AI models. The project is also designed to follow good software engineering practices and to have a clear and organized structure.

The project is structured into several folders and files, each with a specific purpose and function. The main folders and files are:

README.md: This file offers a comprehensive overview of the project, its purpose, instructions for setup, and guidance on how to contribute new prompts to the library.

prompts: This folder contains all the prompts used to instruct AI models. Each prompt is stored as a separate text file named after the prompt itself. The prompts are organized into different categories and subcategories based on their purpose and function, such as translation, text generation, summarization, etc. The categories and subcategories are represented by folders within the prompts folder. Each prompt file also contains a JSON object that specifies the prompt category, subcategory, and any other metadata that might be useful.

config: This folder contains a settings.py file where you can store your OpenAI API key and any other configuration settings that you might need for the project.

scripts: This folder houses Python scripts that are used to automate tasks related to the maintenance and organization of the prompt library, as well as utilizing the prompts via the OpenAI API. The scripts are:

prompt_generator.py: This script allows you to generate new prompts from existing ones by modifying or combining them.
prompt_sender.py: This script allows you to send individual prompts, batches of prompts, or chains of prompts to the OpenAI API and retrieve responses.
prompt_organizer.py: This script allows you to organize and manage the prompts in the library.
tests: This folder contains tests for the scripts to verify their functionality. The tests are written using the pytest framework and can be run using the pytest command.

docs: This folder stores additional documentation about the project, such as design documents, usage guides, or troubleshooting tips.

Setup
To set up the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine, as well as Git. You also need to have an internet connection and an OpenAI API key. To set up the project, you can follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using this command:
git clone https://github.com/Bing/COGOPS_Library.git
Copy
Navigate to the project directory using this command:
cd COGOPS_Library
Copy
Install any dependencies or requirements for the project using this command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy
Create a virtual environment for the project using this command:
python -m venv venv
Copy
Activate the virtual environment using this command:
source venv/bin/activate # for Linux or Mac
venv\Scriptsctivate # for Windows
Copy
Run the tests to verify that everything is working using this command:
pytest tests/
Copy
Replace the placeholder text in the config/settings.py file with your own OpenAI API key using this command:
nano config/settings.py # for Linux or Mac
notepad config/settings.py # for Windows
Copy
You are now ready to use the project.
Scripts
The project contains three scripts that are used to automate tasks related to the maintenance and organization of the prompt library, as well as utilizing the prompts via the OpenAI API. The scripts are:

prompt_generator.py: This script allows you to generate new prompts from existing ones by modifying or combining them.
prompt_sender.py: This script allows you to send individual prompts, batches of prompts, or chains of prompts to the OpenAI API and retrieve responses.
prompt_organizer.py: This script allows you to organize and manage the prompts in the library.
To use these scripts, you need to navigate to the scripts folder using this command:

cd scripts/
Copy
Then, you can use these commands to run each script:

python prompt_generator.py [arguments]
python prompt_sender.py [arguments]
python prompt_organizer.py [arguments]
Copy
Each script takes different arguments depending on what you want to do. You can use this command to see a list of possible arguments for each script:

python prompt_generator.py --help
python prompt_sender.py --help
python prompt_organizer.py --help
Copy
Here are some examples of how you can use each script:

prompt_generator.py
This script allows you to generate new prompts from existing ones by modifying or combining them. For example, you can use this script to generate a prompt for translating English text to Spanish by changing the language parameter of an existing translation prompt. You can also use this script to generate a prompt for generating a summary of a text by chaining two existing prompts: one for extracting the main points of the text, and another for generating a summary from those points.

The script takes as input a source prompt file or files, and outputs a new prompt file in the same format as the existing ones. You can specify various parameters and options for the prompt generation, such as the output file name, the output category and subcategory, the output language and engine, etc.

Here is an example of how you can use this script to generate a prompt for translating English text to Spanish:

python prompt_generator.py --source prompts/translation/english_to_french.txt --output prompts/translation/english_to_spanish.txt --output_language Spanish --output_subcategory English to Spanish
Copy
Here is an example of how you can use this script to generate a prompt for generating a summary of a text by chaining two existing prompts:

python prompt_generator.py --source prompts/text_extraction/main_points.txt prompts/text_generation/summary.txt --output prompts/text_generation/summary_from_main_points.txt --output_category Text Generation --output_subcategory Summary from Main Points --chain
